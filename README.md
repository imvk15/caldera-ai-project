# AI-Assisted Adversary Simulation & Threat Analysis Platform

## Overview

The **AI-Assisted Adversary Simulation & Threat Analysis Platform** is a cybersecurity assessment framework that combines adversary simulation, MITRE ATT&CK technique mapping, automated data processing, Large Language Model (LLM)-based threat analysis, and security visualization.

The objective of this project is to simulate real-world attacker behavior inside a controlled laboratory environment, collect adversary activity data, analyze executed techniques, and transform raw security telemetry into SOC-style threat intelligence.

The platform integrates:

* MITRE Caldera for adversary emulation
* MITRE ATT&CK framework for technique identification
* Python-based data processing pipelines
* Groq LLM integration for automated threat analysis
* Streamlit dashboard for security visualization

# Installation

## 1. Clone Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/imvk15/caldera-ai-project.git

cd caldera-ai-project
```

---

## 2. Create Python Environment

```bash
python3 -m venv venv

source venv/bin/activate
```

---

## 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

# Configuration

Create a `.env` file:

```
GROQ_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

The API key should never be committed to the repository.

---

# Usage

## Data Processing

Convert Caldera reports into structured datasets:

```bash
python scripts/json_parser.py
```

Build processed security datasets:

```bash
python scripts/dataset_builder.py
```

---

## AI Threat Analysis

Run the LLM-based threat analysis module:

```bash
python phase6/groq_analyzer.py
```

Generated reports include:

* Threat summary
* Observed techniques
* Analyst recommendations
* Security insights

---

## Launch Dashboard

Start the Streamlit dashboard:

```bash
python dashboard/app.py
```

The dashboard provides a visual representation of:

* Attack execution timeline
* ATT&CK technique mapping
* Threat analysis results

---

# Sample Workflow

1. Deploy MITRE Caldera in a controlled lab environment.
2. Execute adversary operations using configured abilities.
3. Collect operation reports and event logs.
4. Process collected data using Python scripts.
5. Map behaviors to MITRE ATT&CK techniques.
6. Analyze results using Groq LLM.
7. Display findings through the security dashboard.

# Security Considerations

This project is designed for:

* Cybersecurity education
* Defensive security research
* Controlled adversary simulation
* SOC analyst training

All simulations should be performed only in authorized environments.

Do not deploy adversary simulation capabilities against systems without explicit permission.

---

# Future Improvements

Potential enhancements:

* Real-time log ingestion
* Integration with SIEM platforms
* Automated incident response recommendations
* Additional ATT&CK technique coverage
* Multi-agent attack simulations
* Enhanced threat intelligence correlation
